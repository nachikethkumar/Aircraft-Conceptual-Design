% Landing Analysis
Vapproachknots =sqrt(Sland/0.3) %Sland should be in feet, The approach speed (Va) in knots
Approachspeed = 1.3* stall speed
Touchdown speed = 1.15*stall speed =  knot
Average velocity at Flare = 1.23*stall speed =  knots
FAR field length = 1.666*(approach + flare + ground roll)
